## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-chatbot.git
cd sentiment-chatbot
```

2. Run the chatbot:

### Example Conversation

```
You: I had an amazing day today!
[Sentiment: POSITIVE 😊 | Score: 1.00]
Bot: That's wonderful to hear! Tell me more! 😊

You: trend
📊 Sentiment Analysis: Overall positive conversation 📈
```

## 🧠 How It Works

The chatbot uses a rule-based sentiment analyzer that:
1. Tokenizes your input into words
2. Matches words against positive/negative dictionaries
3. Calculates a sentiment score (-1 to 1)
4. Generates an appropriate empathetic response
5. Tracks sentiment trends across the conversation
